Eco Pulse is a smart waste management platform designed to build cleaner and greener cities. It enables citizens to actively participate in waste reporting and recycling.
Users can report illegal dumps, submit recyclable waste details. The admin  receives the reports in real-time, assigns tasks to cleanup teams, and monitors updates. Cleanup teams can view assigned tasks, mark them as complete.

Cleaner, Greener, Healthier Cities.
